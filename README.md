**🌾 AI-Based Crop Recommendation System for Farmers**

## SIH ID: SIH25030 | Domain: Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development | Organization: Government of Jharkhand

**📌 Background**

Farmers in India often face challenges such as:

Limited access to timely, personalized, and accurate agricultural guidance

Language barriers restricting adoption of digital platforms

Poor reach of conventional advisory services in rural and remote regions

Limited awareness of soil health, crop rotation benefits, and market trends

Generative AI, combined with satellite imagery, IoT, and multilingual conversational interfaces, offers a transformative opportunity to empower farmers with hyper-localized, science-backed crop recommendations.


🎯 Objective

To build an AI-powered decision support system that helps farmers choose the right crop at the right time, based on:

Soil health data (pH, nutrients, moisture) from satellite datasets (Soil Grids, Bhuvan APIs) & IoT sensors

Localized weather forecasts & seasonal patterns

Historical crop rotation data for soil fertility preservation

Real-time market demand & price trends via APIs and agri-market scraping

Sustainability & profitability scores for long-term impact
